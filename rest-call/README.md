# rest-call  

This project uses Scala3 to get weather forecast data from the Japan Meteorological Agency's API. It then extracts specific weather information from the data and formats it accordingly.

## Learning Objectives

* Understanding HTTP requests by Scala3
* Understanding how to parse JSON strings by Scala3
* Using librarires in the project.

## Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can run it with `sbt run`, and test it with `sbt test`.

```
cd ~/scala-training/rest-call
sbt test
sbt run
```
